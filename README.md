# TidyTuesday in Python 🐍📊

Welcome to my **TidyTuesday** explorations — a collection of Python-based data projects inspired by the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) community. Each week, I explore datasets that spark my curiosity, applying Python tools to analyze, visualize, and tell compelling data stories.

## 🌱 About TidyTuesday

[TidyTuesday](https://tidytues.day) is a weekly data project initiated by the R4DS (R for Data Science) community. It promotes learning through hands-on practice with real-world datasets. Although it began in R, the project is language-agnostic — making it a perfect playground for Python data scientists as well.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

This repository primarily uses:

- `pandas`, `numpy` — data wrangling  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` — visualizations  
- `scikit-learn` — basic machine learning and modeling  
- `Shiny for Python` — building interactive dashboards  
- `Jupyter Notebooks` — exploratory analysis and storytelling

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder contains:
- 📊 Notebook-based analysis - `.ipynb`
- 🧪 Visualizations and insights - `app.py`
- 🌐 (Optional) Shiny dashboard for interaction

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Reinforce Python data science skills  
- Practice real-world data storytelling  
- Learn and apply Shiny for Python for dashboards  
- Build a public portfolio of reproducible analyses  
- Engage with the open data community
